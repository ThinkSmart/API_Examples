# API Examples

We will be adding examples around how to use our API to this Github repo.

For now, the only example we have is [this one](https://github.com/ThinkSmart/API_Examples/blob/master/submit.py), with which you can see how to get a token, get a templateID, and submit a workflow with predetermined values.
